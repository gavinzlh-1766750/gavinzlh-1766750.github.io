		<p> Dear Student, You are about to embark on one of the hardest journeys of your life.  It may not seem like it upon first glance, but as you continue to attend classes and do the readings at home, you will realize that what you get out of this class is what you put into it.  That being said, a quarter is a short ten weeks, so I would recommend that you hit the send button and dive all in to the material.  There will be some topics that are easier to understand and relate to than others, yet I encourage you even with these to open your mind further to what your classmates are saying and the stories they are telling you.  Everyone has a valuable voice, and Jondou makes this class a safe space that encourages people to speak up.  There are not many places in this political climate where I have felt encouraged to do so, and thus I will continue to emphasize the importance of taking advantage of this opportunity.  Know that the things that are worthwhile in life require effort, time and perseverance, and this class is one of those things.  You will not regret taking the leap of faith to open up to a classmate.  I shared some of my deepest fears, secrets, and concerns with my seat neighbor, and it was refreshing, for they listened and provided a unique insight that was unbiased, unattached, and frankly refreshing.  Be that seat partner for others too, for they will thank you later.  Overall, this class is a great opportunity to grow beyond what you think you are capable of, so embrace it and have fun! Peace, OB </p>
